### Contributing to the GraalVM Implementation of Python

Thanks for considering to contribute! To get you started, here is a bit of
information about the structure of this implementation.

##### But first...

You will need to sign the [Oracle Contributor
Agreement](http://www.graalvm.org/community/contributors/) for us to be able to
merge your work.

Please also take some time to review our [code of
conduct](http://www.graalvm.org/community/conduct/) for contributors.

##### Getting started

The first thing you want to do is to set up
[mx](https://github.com/graalvm/mx.git). This is the build tool we use to
develop GraalVM languages. You also need LLVM 6, including the `opt` tool -- the
latter is not included on macOS by default, here you can install the homebrew
version of LLVM, which includes this tool. Note that you can use any JDK, and do
not necessarily need GraalVM for development. In that case you'll only be able
to run without the just-in-time compiler, but that can be fine for making and
testing changes that are not performance sensitive.

Once you have `mx` on your `PATH`, you can run `mx build` in this
repository. This will initially download the required dependencies next to the
repository and build Python. If it succeeds without errors, you should already
be able to run `mx python` and get a REPL.

If you just want to copy and paste some commands, these should get you started:

    $ git clone https://github.com/graalvm/mx.git
    $ git clone https://github.com/graalvm/graalpython.git
    $ cd graalpython
    $ ../mx/mx build
    $ ../mx/mx python -c "print(42)"

For development, we recommend running `mx ideinit` next. This will generate
configurations for Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Netbeans so that you can open the
projects in these IDEs. If you use another editor with support for the [Eclipse
language server](https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls) we also had reports
of useable development setups with that, but it's not something we support.

##### Development layout

Besides the source code of the Python interpreter, we have some useful `mx`
functions defined under the `mx.graalpython` directory. As you make changes, you
can test always test them with `mx build && mx python`. Additionally, there are
various "gates" that we use on our CI systems to check any code that goes
in. You can run all of these using `mx python-gate` or just some by using `mx
python-gate --tags [TAG]`. Two interesting gates to run that cover most things
are:

- `python-unittest` - Run the unittests written in Python, including those for the C extension API
- `python-license` - Check that all files have the correct copyright headers applied to them

###### Builtin modules and classes

For the most part, builtin modules and classes are implemented in the
`com.oracle.graal.python.builtins` package. For each module or class, there's
Java class annoted with `@CoreFunctions`. Each function in a module or a class
is implemented in a Node annotated with `@Builtin`. Take a look at the existing
implementations to get a feel for how this is done. For now, when adding new
classes or modules, they need to be added to the list in
`com.oracle.graal.python.builtins.Python3Core`.

Some builtin functions, modules, and classes are implemented in pure Python. The
files for this are in `graalpython/lib-graalpython`. These files are listed in
the Java `com.oracle.graal.python.builtins.Python3Core` class. Take a look at
these files to see what they do. If a file is called exactly as a built-in
module is, it is executed in the context of that module during startup, so some
of our modules are implemented both in Java and Python. If the name matches no
existing module, the file is executed just for the side-effects.

###### Python C API

The C implementation and headers for our C API are in
`graalpython/com.oracle.graal.python.cext`. The naming is analogous to C
Python's source names. This folder also includes a `modules` folder for built-in
modules that we have adapted from C Python.

##### Debug options

The GraalVM implementation of Python provides proper debug options. It is possible to either debug the Python code, using Chrome debugger,   
or the java code, using your preferred IDE. 
The following commands should be executed in a virtualenv environment, which provides a graalpython executable.

For debug Python side code call this:

```graalpython --inspect your_script.py ```

This will open a debug server, which can be accessed in Chrome Browser under URL `chrome://inspect`.

For debugging java implemented code execute:

```graalpython --experimental-options -debug-java your_script.py```

The command will also start a debug server, which can be used in an IDE. If the IDE was initialized properly 
by using the command mentioned above, the existing `GraalDebug` run configuration can be used to debug.
